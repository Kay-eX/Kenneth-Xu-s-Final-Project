<p class="GFtext">Whether you’re a seasoned expert or new to strength training, working out at FitGym is a great option.<br>

Our techniques can be sustained for bodyweight exercises in which you use your body’s own weight as resistance.<br>

They can serve as a weeklong beginner routine or be cycled to provide several sessions per week for advanced trainees.<br>

If your goal is weight loss, you can add a form of cardio, such as running or cycling, between sessions.

<img src="trainer3.jpg" class="GFimage">
<p class="GFtext">
Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles (muscle building) by muscle<br>
 hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes. It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it focuses on<br>
 physical appearance instead of strength. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.<br>
 In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines)<br>
 for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.
